This talk was a three-minute thesis (3MT) presentation of my work on automating the process of tagging and tracking the centre of a vortex even if it is greatly asymmtetric. There was a also a poster presentation competition to accompany the 3MT component where I was able to discuss in greater detail the objectives and outcomes of my research. 

Abstract
=======
I developed an automated method to track the center of simulated tornados within massive datasets. This process involves identifying the strongest rotational areas, calculating perpendicular lines, and analyzing the swirling patterns to pinpoint the exact center. This automation significantly speeds up research, allowing for more complex analyses and a better understanding of tornado behavior, potentially leading to improved forecasting and prevention of damage.
