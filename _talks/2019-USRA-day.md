This talk was a three-minute thesis (3MT) presentation of my work on trying to find methods for wind-engineers to analyse tornado wind-field velocity data as if it were real-world tornado data. There was a also a poster presentation competition to accompany the 3MT component where I was able to discuss in greater detail the objectives and outcomes of my research.

Abstract
=======
This research provides a detailed analysis of a simulated tornado, offering new insights into their formation and behavior. By using a high-resolution supercomputer model, the study was able to capture the complex dynamics of a tornado, including the formation of smaller vortices that contribute to its overall structure. The results challenge previous assumptions based on simplified models, demonstrating that tornado wind speeds can vary significantly from the average. This research highlights the importance of considering these variations for accurate tornado forecasting and understanding the potential for damage.

The study also provides a valuable dataset for future research, as it offers a detailed record of a simulated tornado's life cycle. By analyzing this data, researchers can gain a better understanding of the factors that influence tornado intensity and the potential for severe damage.
