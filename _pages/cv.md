  * Specialized in composite materials, vibration mechanics, and advanced CAD software
  * Designed a novel and robust apparatus to mimic loading the human tibia bone for testing artificial implants as part of a Capstone project for Victoria Hospital (London, ON)
  * Completed a thesis paper on novel developments to tornado simulation techniques

Work Experience
======
* Technical Judge, 2024--Present
  * Evaluated novelty and effectiveness of technical projects and team operational performance
  * Determined score for each team based on their progress from reports to the launch event
  * Attended the Launch Canada 2024 event and assisted with set-up and take-down of the conference and pad areas
* Graduate Teaching Assistant, 2021--2023
  * Taught, set-up experiments, and evaluated students in five undergraduate courses of second to final year students in fluid mechanics, heat transfer, lab experimentation equipment, and material properties
* Undergraduate Research Assistant, 2018--2021
  * Received two separate grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) to work on statistical analyses of tornadoes created by numerically simulated supercells and extract relevant information to apply to engineering models of tornadoes
