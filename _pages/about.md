Welcome to my website! I made this as a way to demonstrate some of my skills and past work and to preserve some memories of mine for all to see. Use the navigation bar to get to the topic of interest to you and, whether you are hiring, interested to know more, or want to tell me how incorrectly I did something, feel free to send me an e-mail.

About Me
======
I recently graduated with my Masters of Engineering Science degree. My background is in fluid dynamics, materials science, computational and numerical simulation, and computer-aided design engineering. Currently, I am likely to be 3D printing something, involved in high-power rocketry, or designing a liquid rocket engine turbopump.
