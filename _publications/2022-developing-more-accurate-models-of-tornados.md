excerpt: 'This conference paper covers the early findings for a novel methodology I applied to extract a precise point location as the centre of a tornado in an isogrid velocity vector field. This eventually became the paper I published in Boundary-Layer Meteorology later in 2022.'

This conference paper covers the early findings for a novel methodology I applied to extract a precise point location as the centre of a tornado in an isogrid velocity vector field. This eventually became the paper I published in Boundary-Layer Meteorology later in 2022.
