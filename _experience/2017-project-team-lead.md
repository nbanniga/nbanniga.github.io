As the Project Technical Lead for the Western Engineering Rocketry Team, I spent five years overseeing the design, development, and testing of the team's rocket. Our goal was to create a robust and flight-stable rocket capable of competing at the Spaceport America Cup.

Overcoming the challenges posed by COVID-19 and the team's inexperience, I led the transition from a basic, purchased rocket airframe to a fully custom carbon fiber composite design optimized for high-speed flight. Through meticulous analysis and design, I addressed key components like the nose cone, fins, bulkheads, and payload, ensuring their structural integrity and performance.

One of my significant accomplishments was the development of a novel airframe coupling interface that combined the functions of a bulkhead and a disassembly mechanism. This innovative design reduced part count and improved reliability. Additionally, I implemented strategies to prevent corrosion, protect the composite exterior, and streamline the manufacturing process.

Beyond the technical aspects, I played a crucial role in team management, stakeholder engagement, and documentation. I mentored team members, secured funding, and created detailed manuals to facilitate knowledge transfer.

Despite facing setbacks and unexpected challenges, our team's dedication and perseverance culminated in a successful launch. The rocket achieved a maximum velocity of 1145 km/h and placed 1st among Canadian teams at the Spaceport America Cup 2022. The experience was both rewarding and humbling, as it showcased the power of teamwork, innovation, and engineering excellence.
