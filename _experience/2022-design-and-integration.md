The Turbopump Project
======

This project is a collective of students and industry members who are working to build a small-scale turbopump to move large quantities of fuel in a small timeframe as a proof-of-concept for integration in a sounding missile rocket.

My Contributions
======

My role has included designing an open-source, spreadsheet-based part management system to automate the process of collecting materials, unit costs, user modifications, iterations, and more to generate a coherent summary of all subsystems. Further, I have been performing the manual calculations to validate numerical simulations, for example, to check pipe flow losses through the coolant lines. I am also responsible for custom designed components including a male-threaded nut to withstand the thrust force along the shaft when the turbopump is active and hold the entire assembly together and a precision bearing spring-preloader to maintain axial loading as thermal or other operating parameters fluctuate.
