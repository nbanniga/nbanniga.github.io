    <li>Received two separate grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) to work on statistical analyses of tornadoes created by numerically simulated supercells and extract relevant information to apply to engineering models of tornadoes</li>
</ul>

As an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Western Ontario, I had the option to work under a graduate student or to take on the challenge of a multi-year spanning project to understand the formation of tornadoes. Naturally, I said yes to the challenge and received NSERC funding to investigating tornado formation in the most accurate numerical simulations ever produced. My primary responsibility was to develop computational tools for analyzing wind-field data extracted from these simulations.

I created automated scripts to streamline the data processing pipeline, enabling efficient and repeatable analysis. These scripts were designed to extract, process, and visualize key tornado characteristics, such as wind speed, pressure, and vorticity.

Through this research, I gained valuable experience in data analysis, scientific programming, and research methodologies. These skills strengthened my academic foundation and prepared me for my master's degree where I continued this project and narrowed in on two focused paper topics, one of which has been published and the other is under review.
