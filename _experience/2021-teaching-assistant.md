<ul>
    <li>Taught, set-up experiments, and evaluated students in five undergraduate courses of second to final year students in fluid mechanics, heat transfer, lab experimentation equipment, and material properties</li>
</ul>

I demonstrated lab procedures and outcomes, elaborated upon classroom topics and stepped through homework problems. Furthermore, I graded assignments and exams and, occasionally, taught lectures in five undergraduate courses including: mechanics of materials, fluid dynamics and heat transfer, engineering experimentation, mechanical component design, and composite design. This covered students from second year to fourth year engineering and amounted to approximately 70 hours per course of experience, not including time I spent to prepare extra information to help students.

MSE 2273B -- Introduction to Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer
======
I demonstrated problem-solving techniques related to fluid flow, manometry, dynamic systems, and heat transfer. I also proctored exams and marked assignments, creating automated marking workflows to get through the 200+ students' work for each.

MSE 2285B -- Engineering Experimentation
======
I developed supplementary lecture material on Arduino circuits and guided students through homework problems involving system sensitivity, binary/hexadecimal conversions, and uncertainty analysis. I also proctored and marked the final exam, developing an automated marking workflow to rapidly get through all exams and to detect grade anomalies as a function of the seating arrangement during the exam.

MME 4446B -- Composite Materials
======
I conducted laboratory sessions focused on producing and curing flat-panel glass fiber composites. I answered student questions, graded assignments on composite strength calculations, and proctored the final exam. I also marked the midterm and final exams.

MSE 3380B -- Mechanical Component Design
======
I lead laboratory sessions on mechanical fasteners and industrial pumps. I proctored exams and marked quizzes, projects, and final exams.

MME 2212A -- Mechanics of Materials
======
I conducted laboratory sessions on strain gauge measurements and proctored the midterm exam. I also developed an automated marking workflow to improve future assignment grading efficiency.
