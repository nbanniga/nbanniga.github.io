01/11/2024	Quantifying the Asymmetry in Tornado Vortex Wind-Fields Using Numerical Simulations of Supercell Thunderstorms	Journal of Wind Engineering & Industrial Aerodynamics	This paper attempts to provide updates to existing engineering analysis techniques for simulated tornadoes in order to capture asymmetry and motion that one would expect of real tornadoes in order to open up the possibilty for developing more accurate engineering tornado simulations in the future.

01/06/2022	Developing more accurate models of tornados	Proceedings of the Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering International Congress 2022	This conference paper covers the early findings for a novel methodology I applied to extract a precise point location as the centre of a tornado in an isogrid velocity vector field. This eventually became the paper I published in Boundary-Layer Meteorology later in 2022.	"Bannigan, N., Orf, L. & Savory, E. (2022).
