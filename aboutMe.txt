I recently graduated with my Masters of Engineering Science degree. 
                      My background is in fluid dynamics, materials science, computational 
                      and numerical simulation, and computer-aided design engineering. 
                      Currently, I am likely to be 3D printing something, involved in 
                      high-power rocketry, or designing a liquid rocket engine turbopump.
