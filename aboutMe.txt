I recently graduated with my Masters of Engineering Science degree. My background is in fluid dynamics, materials science, computational and numerical simulation, and computer-aided design engineering. When I am not doing school-related projects, I am likely to be 3D printing something, involved in high-power rocketry, or designing a liquid rocket engine turbopump.
